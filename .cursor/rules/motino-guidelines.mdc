### Guidelines for Creating Emotional Motion Design

- **Prioritize Speed and Timing**
  - Great animations are _fast_ but not rushed; they deliver information quickly and keep attention without lagging or dragging.
  - Use timing to evoke emotion: faster motions can convey excitement or urgency; slower, smoother motions can evoke calm or elegance

- **Use CSS Transforms and Clip-Path Creatively**
  - Leverage **CSS transforms** (translate, scale, rotate) for smooth, hardware-accelerated animations that feel natural and fluid
  - Employ **clip-path** to create dynamic reveals and mask effects that add a magical, surprising quality to transitions

- **Apply the 12 Principles of Animation Adapted for UI**
  - Incorporate **anticipation**: prepare the user’s eye by moving elements slightly in the opposite direction before the main action
  - Use **arcs** instead of linear motion to mimic natural movement and increase visual appeal
  - Implement **ease-in and ease-out** easing curves to make motion feel organic and less mechanical
  - Convey **mass and weight** by adjusting speed and acceleration according to the perceived heaviness of objects

- **Keep Motion Purposeful and Clear**
  - Every motion must serve a function: guide attention, provide feedback, or tell a story
  - Avoid unnecessary or overly complex animations that distract or confuse users
  - Use motion to _highlight_ key elements and evoke the desired emotional response (e.g., delight, trust, urgency)

- **Maintain Consistency and Simplicity**
  - Use consistent easing, timing, and style across the interface to create a cohesive experience
  - Keep animations simple and minimalistic to avoid overwhelming users; let the message shine through

- **Incorporate Follow-through and Overlapping Action**
  - Elements should continue moving slightly after the main action to simulate natural physics and add realism
  - Layer animations so secondary movements complement the primary action, enriching the emotional depth

- **Storyboard and Plan Your Motion**
  - Sketch storyboards to map out key frames and transitions before animating; this ensures clarity and emotional impact.
  - Design with contrast in size, color, and value to enhance composition and emotional storytelling.

- **Use Motion to Enhance Brand Personality**
  - Reflect the brand’s voice and values through motion style—playful, elegant, bold, or subtle—to emotionally connect with users
