Taxco is my personal portfolio where I will share articles about technology and other topics that interest me. It marks my first complete personal project.

Taxco bears some resemblance to Medium, but it's exclusively for my use. Currently, I am in the process of learning TypeScript, React, and frontend development in general. While I am more accustomed to backend development, Taxco is designed to be a full-stack project. I am committed to adhering to best practices for frontend development as I continue to explore and learn.

> For some components, I am utilizing Chakra UI.

### Requirements

To run Taxco, you only need to have Node installed. ‚ù§

    git clone https://github.com/IvanCCO/Taxco
    cd Taxo
    npm install
    npm start
